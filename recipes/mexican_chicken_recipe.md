# Ingredients

 - 1lb chicken breast/tenders
 - 1/2 chicken bouillon cube
 - 4oz salsa
 - 4oz water
 - taco seasoning

# Instructions

1. Open Instant Pot.
2. Place chicken in pot on top of rack.
3. Evenly scatter decent helping of taco seasoning on chicken
4. Put 4oz salsa, 4oz water, and 1/3 - 1/2 cube of bouillon on chicken.
5. Close Instant Pot and set for 15 minutes (or poultry setting). Make sure the valve on the pressure cooker is closed.
6. If the chicken is frozen, check the chicken to see if it's done (whether it shreds easily). 
   1. If it's not done, it'll feel difficult to shred (like rubber). If it isn't done, repeat step (5). 
   2. Otherwise, take out the rack, stir the chicken inside the pot, shred the chicken, and serve, ideally in a tortilla with beans, cheese, lettuce, etc.
