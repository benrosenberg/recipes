# Ingredients

 - 2 chicken breasts with skin (.75lb)
 - 1/2 bouillon cube
 - potatoes
 - carrots
 - other green vegetables (optional)
 - 1 lemon
   - half for juice, and other half for 3 slices
 - 5 garlic cloves
 - herb blend seasoning
 - onion/onion powder
 - olive oil
 - 1/2 cup (4 oz) water
 - salt
 - pepper

# Instructions

1. Put chicken in Instant Pot, skin side down
2. Add salt and pepper on top
3. Push the "Sautee" button
4. Every 5 minutes or so, wiggle the chicken with tongs to see if it moves easily.
   1. While the chicken is being sauteed, peel and chop the carrots, and chop the potatoes. 
   2. Slice the lemon in half
      1. Juice one half over the chicken
      2. Slice the other half to obtain three lemon slices
   3. Manipulate head of garlic to obtain 5 cloves if necessary
   4. Prepare other vegetables as necessary
5. Eventually, turn it over. The chicken should be lightly browned
6. Add more salt and pepper to other side
7. When it's lightly browned all around, turn off the Instant Pot (by hitting "Stop/Clear") and remove the chicken to a plate
8. Put in the Instant Pot metal rack 
9.  Put the chicken back into the pot on top of the rack
10. Load in all the vegetables, bouillon, water, etc. 
11. Sprinkle liberally with herbs (and onion powder if no onions present)
12. Drizzle some olive oil on top (about 1 tbsp)
13. Put the lid on the Instant Pot
14. Set the Instant Pot to chicken (or "Poultry")
15. When the pot beeps for the second time, it's ready
16. Remove the rack, stir everything in the pot, shred the chicken. Remove the chicken skin if visible, and consider removing lemon rinds. (Make sure to remove lemon rinds if saved as leftovers, otherwise they will make the dish bitter.)
17. Serve, with toasted bread and butter if available
